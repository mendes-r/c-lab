## Algorithm

- 1: Make a fraction with the decimal number as the numerator and a 1 as the denominator.
- 2: Remove the decimal places by multiplication.
- 3: Reduce the fraction. Find the Greatest Common Factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator and divide both numerator and denominator by the GCF.
- 4: Simplify the remaining fraction to a mixed number fraction if possible (improper fraction).
- 5: When number 3 stops being possible, find the most close GCF and store the remainder so that a reverse process is possible.
- 6: Repeat from step 3 if necessary.

### How to Convert an Improper Fraction to a Mixed Number

An improper fraction is any fraction where the numerator is greater than the denominator. Examples of improper fractions are 16/3, 81/9, 525/71.

- 1: Divide the numerator by the denominator
- 2: Write down the whole number result
- 3: Use the remainder as the new numerator over the denominator. This is the fraction part of the mixed number.
